### Homework 1. Due Friday, September 1

* Ex 1.1. Show that the properties (a)--(c) of a measure imply finite addivitity: If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint then $m(A\cup B)=m(A)+m(B)$.
* Ex 1.2. Show that the properties (a)--(c) of a measure imply the inclusion--exclusion principle: For any sets $A,B$ we have $m(A\cup B)+m(A\cap B)=m(A)+m(B)$.
* Ex 1.3. Complete the details of the proof that if there is a measure on $\RR$ satisfying properties (a)--(c), then there is a measure on $[0,1)$ (with additional modulo $1$) satisfying properties (a)--(c).
* Ex 2.1 = Tao Ex 1.1.1. Show that the class of elementary sets is closed under the operations: union, intersection, set difference, symmetric difference, and translation.
* Ex 2.2. Prove the elementary measure satisfies the monotonicity and finite subadditivity properties.
